Title: Web Request Indicator LED
Date: 2013-1-21

The idea here is pretty simple. Each time someone visits this website I want to make an LED connected to a GPIO pin flash.

Things I have/know...
-LED connected to GPIO pins
-script to control it 

Things I will need to figure out,,,
-how html requests are processed by the local machine
-how to trigger a script to run based on the above event
